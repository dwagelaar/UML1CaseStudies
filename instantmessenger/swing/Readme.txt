Instant Messenger - Swing Version
=================================

This version was derived from InstantMessengerModel.xmi
through the following operations:

* Ant is run on
  UML1CaseStudies/instantmessenger/model/outmodels/swing/build.xml
* Code is generated from 
  UML1CaseStudies/instantmessenger/model/outmodels/swing/im-swing-output.xmi
  with Poseidon CE 3.0.1

Note that the Swing version also includes the AWT view; it defaults to the
Swing view, but if that fails it falls back to the AWT view. As such, this
version also runs on J2ME Personal Profile.
